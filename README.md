# hangman-py
**Offline single-/multiplayer Hangman, written in Python.**

_"hangman.py"_ is the "multiplayer" version of Hangman, where one person writes the word and the other person/people have to guess.

_"hangman_random.py"_ is the "singeplayer" version, where the word is randomly generated from words.txt, a file containing all words in the english vocabulary containing letters only from a-z. (https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

_"hangman_simplified.py"_ is essentially the same as the previous one, however, it uses the JUST WORDS! USA English dictionary (http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm), which has far less words than the entire english vocabulary.

_"hangman_allinone"_ is the complete version of Hangman, featuring all 3 versions of Hangman in one.

**NOTE:** Due to the way the code accesses the text files, you must keep the executable files in the same directory as them. Shortcuts are allowed though.

**HINT:** If you get stuck or want to skip a word, type "stop" when inputting a letter.
