# hangman-py
Offline single-/multiplayer Hangman, written in Python.

"hangman.py" is the "multiplayer" version of Hangman, where one person writes the word and the other person/people have to guess.

"hangman_random.py" is the "singeplayer" version, where the word is randomly generated from words.txt, a file containing all words in the english vocabulary containing letters only from a-z. (https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

"hangman_simplified.py" is essentially the same as the previous one, however, it uses the JUST WORDS! USA English dictionary (http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm), which has far less words than the entire english vocabulary.
